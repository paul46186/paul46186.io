## Welcome to Paul's Pages

### Intro
I am studying MS Business Analytics and Information Management in Purdue University. With prior experience gathering, cleaning, and visualizing data, I am able to analyze data and make informed decisions with business acumen. Recently completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate - a comprehensive, hands-on program that encompasses the entire data analysis process.

In undergrad, I majored in Industrial and Information Management. I led a team of five people through a special topic research project, "Assembly line balancing problem with machines and skilled workers constraints". 

### My skill set
SQL, Excel VBA, Tableau, R, and Python.
